If you'd like to enhance your task list manager or explore additional features, here are some ideas:

1. **Local Storage Integration:**
   - Save tasks to the browser's local storage, so tasks persist even if the user refreshes the page or closes the browser.

2. **Task Sorting:**
   - Add the ability to sort tasks based on different criteria, such as due date, priority, or completion status.

3. **Filtering Tasks:** - Done
   - Implement filters to show only completed tasks, incomplete tasks, or tasks due today.

4. **Editing Tasks:**
   - Allow users to edit task details, such as the task name, due date, or description.

5. **Task Categories:**
   - Introduce the concept of task categories or tags. Allow users to categorize tasks and view tasks within specific categories.

6. **Task Priority:**
   - Include a priority level for tasks and implement sorting or filtering based on task priority.

7. **Task Reminders:**
   - Add the ability to set reminders for tasks, and send notifications or alerts when a task is due.

8. **Task Deletion Confirmation:**
   - Implement a confirmation prompt before deleting a task to prevent accidental deletions.

9. **User Authentication:**
   - If you want to add more complexity, consider implementing user authentication. This would allow users to have their own personalized task lists.

10. **Responsive Design:**
    - Ensure your task manager is responsive, so it works well on various devices and screen sizes.

11. **Data Visualization:**
    - Include charts or graphs to visualize task completion statistics over time.

Remember to take small steps and implement one feature at a time. This way, you can gradually enhance your project while learning and practicing new concepts. Good luck with your task list manager!
